# CS6380 : Computer Vision (IIT Madras, Jul–Nov 2025)

This repository is a student-curated supplement for the **Computer Vision** course offered by the Video Processing Lab (VPL), IIT Madras.

## Why This Repo Exists

The official course site already provides **lecture materials**.  
This repo is intended to **complement** those resources by adding:

- 📚 **Reference materials** (textbooks, notes, papers)  
- 📝 **Exam papers with solutions** for practice  
- 💻 **Assignments** <!-- with my own worked-out solutions and implementations  -->
- ⚡ **Code examples & notebooks** <!--  demonstrating algorithms across the syllabus (feature extraction, segmentation, motion analysis, etc.) -->

This way, the repo serves as both a **study aid** and a **code companion** to the official content.
